# Python Examples

This directory contains a number of examples of python workflows to run simulations with pEpiabm.

## Simulation Flow

This script runs a basic simulation with a population of 100 individuals, spread across 20 households in a single cell and microcell.

It subsequently saves the results to a .csv file, and plots a basic SIR plot of the simulation output.

## Simulation Flow - Spatial

This script runs a basic simulation with spatial dependance. It considers a population of 1000 individuals, spread across 40 households in 20 cells, each with a single microcell.

It subsequently saves the results to a .csv file, and plots the infection curve for each region.
