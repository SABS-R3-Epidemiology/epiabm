The 2 csv files in this folder contain data on the speed of our code before we sped it up. 
old_intervention_basic_speeds.csv uses the basic simulation after the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
old_intervention_spatial_speeds.csv uses the spatial simulation with 200 cells and 2 microcells per cell after the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
These files contain the necessary code for interventions but none of the interventions are active but the checks for whether they are active are included.
To run this code again use the code as it was in the following commit:
