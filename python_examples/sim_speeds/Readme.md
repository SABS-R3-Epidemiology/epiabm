The 4 csv files in this folder contain data on the speed of our code before we sped it up. 
old_basic_speeds.csv uses the basic simulation before the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
old_intervention_basic_speeds.csv uses the basic simulation after the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
old_spatial_speeds.csv uses the spatial simulation with 200 cells and 2 microcells per cell before the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
old_intervention_spatial_speeds.csv uses the spatial simulation with 200 cells and 2 microcells per cell after the interventions code was included for varying population sizes.
The 2 files with intervention in the name contain the necessary code for interventions but none of the interventions are active but the checks for whether they are active are included.
