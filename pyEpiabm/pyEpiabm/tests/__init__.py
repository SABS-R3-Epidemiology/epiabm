#
# Test module for pyEpiabm
#
# To run all tests, run ``python -m unittest discover`` from pyEpiabm*.
#   (or `python3` instead of `python` depending on your Python installation)
# To run a particular test, use e.g.
#  ``python -m unittest pyEpiabm.tests.test_population``.
#
# These commands should both be run from epiabm/pyEpiabm
#
# Alternatively, use the run_tests.py methods for unit tests with coverage:
#   `coverage run pyEpiabm/run_tests.py --unit`  (from the epiabm/ directory)
# Report coverage with `coverage report -m`, or build html with `coverage html`
#
